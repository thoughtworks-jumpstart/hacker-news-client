# Hacker News Lab

### Getting started
- Fork and clone repo
- `cd hacker-news-client`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- `npm start`


### Tasks
- In `NewsFeed.js`, display the hacker news articles hard-coded in `seedData.js`. Incrementally flesh out the data in `this.state.articles`. Try to create new components (e.g. an `Article` component) as you see fit. 

- Bonus: implement the following features in your app
  - allow users to upvote articles
